# swiss-scrabble

A swiss pairing system for Scrabble. based on https://github.com/gnomeby/swiss-system-chess-tournament/
That was the only python implementation of the swiss pairing system that I could find which adhered closely
to the specifications set by FIDE.

For scrabble unfortunately there isn't anything at all. The most popular scrabble pairing software, TSH does
not provide a complete implementation of the swiss pairing system. It's implementation is more like the monroe system
(King Of The Hill in scrabble speak)
